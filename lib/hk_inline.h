 * installs are serialized by a mutex held across trampoline allocation, relocation
 * and the text writes, so two hooks cannot interleave and a restore cannot run inside
 * an install. the write itself is still not atomic: the detour is several instructions
 * long, its length is reported by the p3 count line at install time, so a core that
 * executes the target while the write happens can run a half written instruction stream
 * the lock takes the second writer out, not the reader
 *
 * a target that is executing during installation, a device_add style hot path, is
 * therefore still not safe to hook. use the kprobe entries there. the entry window is
 * written with one call, so a multi instruction detour is written from a stop_machine
 * callback and only a single word goes through the direct path
 *
 * the detour covers HK_INLINE_PATCH_LEN bytes from the entry, so a target whose symbol is
 * shorter than that shares its window with the next function. the library records the
 * window of every live hook and refuses an install that overlaps one, -EBUSY names both
 * symbols, hk_inline_probe reports the length it would write and the same collision

 * the prologue answer is signature based. a known stub comes back hooked, an
 * ftrace patch site comes back patchsite, a direct b comes back branched, and
 * target is the entry a hook would write to: the end of the branch chain when
 * the entry is a thunk the library follows, the entry itself otherwise. an adrp
 * add br stub and a patch that leaves the first instructions alone are not
 * recognised, so plain means no known stub was found, it is not proof of an
 * untouched prologue.
 *
 * collision means another live hook owns part of the window, the install would
 * return -EBUSY, and collide_addr is the start of that window. the probe reads
 * the installed window table, a hook installed after the probe is not in it
 *
 * 0 when the report was filled, -EINVAL on a NULL argument.
